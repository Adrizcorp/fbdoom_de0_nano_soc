# Doom for Linux Frambuffer

This port of the original Doom source code targets Linux Framebuffer, without any intermediate abstraction layer (like SDL).  
Taken from https://github.com/stoffera/fbdoom

This port depends only on *stdlib*.

On @stoffera version there is no implementation of the keyboard, however, I have enabled the Keyboard on this new version and I have tested it on the DE0-NANO-SOC using an USB DisplayLink DL-165 as a video interface.

I will be soon enabling the audio, so it is fully playable.
